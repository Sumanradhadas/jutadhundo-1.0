🟡 What is JutaDhundo.com?

JutaDhundo.com is a clean, fast, static search website that helps people find Circle information (JUTA) using Village Name or Thana Number — even when they don’t know the exact spelling.

“Juta” here is used as a friendly nickname for Circle, making the platform local, memorable, and relatable.

🎯 Purpose of the Website

Many people:

Don’t know their Circle name

Have only partial village names

Make spelling mistakes

Know the Thana number but not the villages

👉 JutaDhundo.com solves this problem instantly.

🖥️ Overall Look & Feel

Modern, minimal, beautiful

Light background (white / off-white)

Accent color: yellow + dark blue

Clean typography (simple, readable)

Mobile-first & responsive

Very fast (static site, Netlify-hosted)

🧷 Branding & Logo

Website name at top: 🥿 JutaDhundo

A simple shoe icon (Juta) beside the name

Tagline under logo:

“Find your Circle in seconds”

The shoe icon subtly represents “Juta = Circle”, not footwear shopping.

🔍 Main Feature: Smart Search Box

At the center of the homepage:

Search Input:

“Enter Village Name or Thana Number”

What users can type:

Full village name

Partial village name

Wrong spelling

Thana number

✨ Smart Search Behavior (Very Important)
1️⃣ Auto Suggestions (after 3 letters)

As soon as user types 3 characters, suggestions appear below the search box

Suggestions update live as user types

Works for:

Village names

Thana numbers

Example:

User types: "Ajn"
Suggestions:
• Ajni Ghat
• Ajni Tola
• Ajnaipur

2️⃣ Spelling Mistake Friendly (Meaning-based match)

If someone types the wrong spelling, the site still helps.

Example:

User types: "Ajnee"
Results shown:
• Ajni Ghat (Closest match)
• Ajni Tola


This helps users who:

Heard the village name verbally

Don’t know English spelling

Type Hindi-sounding English

3️⃣ One Thana Number → Multiple Results

Very important feature ✔️

If one Thana number has multiple villages, the site shows ALL matching records, not just one.

Example search:

Thana No: 176

Results displayed as a list:
Thana No: 176
Circle: BARAHIYA (LAKHISARAI)

• Ajni Ghat
• Ajni Tola
• Barahiya East
• Barahiya West


Each village shown clearly under the same Thana/Circle group.

📋 Result Display Design

Results appear in clean cards, not raw text.

Each card shows:

🏡 Village Name

🧾 Thana Number

🥿 Circle Name (Juta)

If multiple results exist:

Cards are stacked neatly

Same Thana/Circle grouped together

Easy to scan and read
